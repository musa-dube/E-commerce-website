                <p>It may be tempting to pop a pimple, but it's important to resist this urge. So it's not good for your skin. First, the erupting pimple can lead to scarring as it damages tissue and causes deep infection. It also spreads bacteria and increases the risk of breakage. Bursting pimples are often caused by inflammation, redness, and swelling and draw attention to where you want to hide them.</p>

                <p>It also speeds up the healing process as the skin needs time to heal itself naturally. Instead, opt for good skincare routines such as cleansing, exfoliating and anti-aging creams to effectively control acne and maintain healthy skin.</p>

                <p>
                Careflow's skin care products are game changing in improving overall skin quality. The new Turmeric Lemon Serum and Lavender Face Serum are packed with powerful antioxidants and nutrients to rejuvenate the skin, leaving it glowing and healthy.
